## BADFit

Code is conditional on the successful installation of Sherpa with access to XSpec models.

XSpec Installation: 
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/

Sherpa Installation:
https://sherpa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Source install with conda:
https://sherpa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/index.html#source-install-with-conda

Run example.py after installation and use it as a guide. A successful run will populate the output directory.


## Acknowledgements

We thank Marcin Marculewicz, Ashley Hai Tung Tan, and Yanina Lopez Bonilla for testing the installation and raising several issues.
